# Rulers

A (WIP) Rack-based web framework, guided by the book [Rebuilding Rails][1].

## Usage

See [`example_apps/best_quotes`][2]

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

Run [`bin/dev`][3] to start the example app `BestQuotes` with hot-reloading.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
